Heirloom
========

The goal of Heirloom is to securely and easily transport data to cloud hosted applciations.

Heirloom creates archives from directories. Their archives are versioned and hosted in geographic distributed locations. Heirloom tracks metadata about those archives, both about the archive locations, as well as arbitrary tags which can be set by an engineer or process. It supports encryption and authorization to allow for securely transporting sensitive data over cloud storage services.
